# Focus AR

## Overview

**Focus AR** is a mobile Augmented Reality (AR) application designed as part of a master's thesis to explore the impact of focus-based interaction in industrial training settings. The project aims to improve user engagement and interaction accuracy by implementing gaze-based interaction techniques, allowing users to control AR elements more intuitively. By optimizing for gaze and dwell time, Focus AR aims to reduce accidental inputs and enhance deliberate interaction—an essential feature for complex AR environments used in professional training.

## Abstract

With the growing adoption of Augmented Reality in industrial applications, **Focus AR** investigates how focus-based interaction mechanics can make training more effective and immersive. The application leverages gaze tracking and dwell-time metrics to create a more accurate and user-friendly interface, minimizing accidental triggers and improving user focus on relevant content. This research aims to bridge the gap between AR technology and human-computer interaction by tailoring the interaction to reduce cognitive load and enhance usability in technical training scenarios.

## Key Features

- **Gaze-based Interaction**: Uses focus and dwell time for intuitive interactions.
- **Industrial Training Scenarios**: Designed specifically for use in industrial training environments.
- **Reduced Accidental Triggers**: Focus AR minimizes unintentional inputs, allowing for smooth, accurate interactions.
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Reduces cognitive load and creates a more immersive experience.

## Project Structure

- **Scripts**: Contains scripts for implementing gaze-based interaction.
- **Assets**: 3D models, prefabs, and images designed for training modules.
- **Scenes**: Scene files configured for AR and gaze tracking within Unity.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To use **Focus AR**, ensure you have the following set up:

1. **Unity**: Version 2019.2.4f1 or compatible.
2. **AR Foundation**: Unity’s AR framework for mobile AR.
3. **ARCore/ARKit**: For deployment on Android or iOS devices.

### Installation

1. Clone or download the Focus AR project folder.
2. Open the project in Unity.
3. Import necessary AR packages (AR Foundation, ARCore/ARKit as needed).
4. Deploy to an AR-compatible mobile device for testing and use.

## Methodology and Findings

Focus AR is part of a thesis that includes:

1. A literature review on AR in training.
2. Development of AR prototypes with Unity and AR Foundation.
3. Testing gaze-based vs. traditional interaction models, focusing on ease of use, user preference, and engagement.
