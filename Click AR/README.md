# Click AR

## Overview

**Click AR** is an AR mobile application developed as part of a master's thesis comparing traditional button-click interactions with gaze-based mechanics in augmented reality. It provides a baseline AR interaction model commonly used in mobile AR applications, using click-based input to interact with AR content. This project serves as a comparative study to **Focus AR**, exploring the strengths and limitations of standard button-click interaction in industrial training scenarios.

## Abstract

Click AR represents the traditional interaction method in AR mobile applications, where users interact with AR elements through click-based inputs. This project is part of a broader study investigating user preferences, efficiency, and ease of use when comparing focus-based and button-click interactions. Findings from the comparison highlight how click-based AR can be effective but may present limitations in precision and require more deliberate user actions in detailed or fast-paced industrial environments.

## Key Features

- **Traditional Button-Click Interaction**: Allows users to interact with AR objects through standard click actions.
- **Industrial Training Use Case**: Provides AR training simulations for comparative analysis with gaze-based interaction models.
- **User Experience Benchmark**: Serves as a baseline for evaluating newer, focus-based AR interaction models.

## Project Structure

- **Scripts**: Contains scripts supporting button-click interaction.
- **Assets**: Prefabs, models, and images used in training and instructional modules.
- **Scenes**: Unity scenes configured for AR with click-based interaction.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure the following are installed to run **Click AR**:

1. **Unity**: Version 2019.2.4f1 or compatible.
2. **AR Foundation**: Unityâ€™s AR framework.
3. **ARCore/ARKit**: For testing and deployment on Android/iOS.

### Installation

1. Clone or download the Click AR project folder.
2. Open the project in Unity and import necessary AR packages (AR Foundation, ARCore/ARKit).
3. Build and deploy to an AR-capable mobile device to test click-based interaction.

## Methodology and Findings

As part of a comparative thesis, Click AR helped analyze:

1. Differences in usability and efficiency between button-click and gaze-based interactions.
2. Impact on user accuracy and cognitive load in training contexts.
3. Insights on user preferences for traditional vs. gaze-based AR interactions.
